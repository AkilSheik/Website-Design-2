<p style= "margin-left:24%; font-size: 25px;  max-width: 75%;">As with all things, there is a downside. If you are paying a company to use its service, you are trusting the company
to secure your data from data breaches. No data is 100% secure, and there have been many breaches. You could take matters into your own hands, but that requires you to secure your own cloud
properly. As clouds use accounts, which can be broken into, security is a huge concern. There is also the problem of it being reliant on the internet. If you are stuck in a place with no internet,
 you cannot access the cloud, and therefore, what you stored in it, in contrast to just storing your data locally. Therefore, it is not reccomended to rely on just the cloud, and the best way to
store would be to have your most confidential information safe locally, and what you do not mind losing or getting out to the internet, on the cloud.
